# MySQL advanced

Here in this specific project I will deep dive in to Advanced MySQL projects and its practical implementations.

At the end of the project I am expected to be able to understand and get hands-on experience:

- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Definition:

#### MySQL:

is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
"SQL", the acronym for Structured Query Language. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.
